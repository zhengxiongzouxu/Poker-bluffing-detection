    "### 2.1 Regression-based Text Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The method based on the regression text detection method is similar to the method of the target detection algorithm. The text detection method has only two categories. The text in the image is regarded as the target to be detected, and the rest is regarded as the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Horizontal Text Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Early text detection algorithms based on deep learning are improved from the target detection method and support horizontal text detection. For example, the TextBoxes algorithm is improved based on the SSD algorithm, and the CTPN is improved based on the two-stage target detection Fast-RCNN algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TextBoxes[1], the algorithm is adjusted according to the one-stage target detector SSD, and the default text box is changed to a quadrilateral that adapts to the specifications of the text direction and aspect ratio, providing an end-to-end training text detection method without complicated Post-processing.\n",
    "-Use a pre-selection box with a larger aspect ratio\n",
    "-The convolution kernel has been changed from 3x3 to 1x5, which is more suitable for long text detection\n",
    "-Adopt multi-scale input\n",

    "CTPN[3] is based on the Fast-RCNN algorithm, expands the RPN module and designs a CRNN-based module to allow the entire network to detect text sequences from convolutional features. The two-stage method obtains more accurate feature positioning through ROI Pooling. But TextBoxes and CTPN only support the detection of horizontal text.\n",

First, modify the aspect ratio of the preselection box and adjust the aspect ratio to 1, 2, 3, 5, 1/2, 1/3, 1/5. The second is to change the $1*5$ convolution kernel to $3*5$ to better learn the characteristics of the slanted text; finally, the representation information of the output rotating box of TextBoxes++.\n",

    "EAST [4] proposed a two-stage text detection method for the location of slanted text, including FCN feature extraction and NMS part. EAST proposes a new text detection pipline structure, which can be trained end-to-end and supports the detection of text in any orientation, and has the characteristics of simple structure and high performance. FCN supports the output of inclined rectangular frame and horizontal frame, and the output format can be freely selected.\n",
    "-If the output detection shape is RBox, output Box rotation angle and AABB text shape information, AABB represents the offset to the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the text box. RBox can rotate rectangular text.\n",
    "-If the output detection box is a four-point box, the last dimension of the output is 8 numbers, which represents the position offset from the four corner vertices of the quadrilateral. This output method can predict irregular quadrilateral text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the text box output by FCN is relatively redundant, for example, the box generated by the adjacent pixels of a text area has a high degree of coincidence. But it is not the detection frame generated by the same text, and the degree of coincidence is very small. Therefore, EAST proposes to merge the prediction boxes by row first. Finally, filter the remaining quads with the original NMS.\n",

In addition, the Instance-wise IoU loss function is also proposed during training, which is used to balance training to handle text instances of different scales. This method can be combined with the EAST method, and has better detection effect and performance in detecting texts with extreme aspect ratios and different scales.\n",

The method consists of three parts: the coordinate regression module DR, the iterative optimization module IRM and the arbitrary shape expression module SEM. They are used to generate approximate text regions, iteratively optimize text localization features, and predict text regions, text centerlines, and text boundaries. Iteratively optimized text features can better solve the problem of long text localization and obtain more accurate text area localization.\n",

The feature is represented by contour points. Finally, by considering the feature responses in two orthogonal directions at the same time, the Point Re-Scoring algorithm can effectively filter out the prediction of strong unidirectional or weak orthogonal activation, and the final text contour can be used as a group of high-quality contour points are shown.\n",

Coordinates, and then the curved text is predicted by superimposing multiple CLM modules and RCLM modules. This method uses the text contour information aggregation to obtain a rich text contour feature representation, which can not only suppress the influence of redundant noise points on the coordinate regression, but also locate the text area more accurately.\n",

    "### 2.2 Text Detection Based on Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the regression-based method has achieved good results in text detection, it is often difficult to obtain a smooth text surrounding curve for solving curved text, and the model is more complex and does not have performance advantages. Therefore, researchers proposed a text segmentation method based on image segmentation. First, classify at the pixel level, determine whether each pixel belongs to a text target, obtain the probability map of the text area, and obtain the enclosing curve of the text segmentation area through post-processing. .\n",

    "Pixellink [7] uses a segmentation method to solve the text detection problem. The segmentation object is a text area. The pixels in the same text line (word) are linked together to segment the text, and the text bounding box is directly extracted from the segmentation result without a position. Regression can achieve the effect of text detection based on regression. However, there is a problem with the segmentation-based method. For texts with similar positions, the text segmentation area is prone to \"sticky\" problems. Wu, Yue et al. [8] proposed to separate the text while learning the boundary position of the text to better distinguish the text area. In addition, Tian et al. [9] proposed to map the pixels of the same text to the mapping space. In the mapping space, the distance of the mapping vector of the unified text is close, and the distance of the mapping vector of different texts becomes longer.\n",
